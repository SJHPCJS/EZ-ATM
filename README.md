# EZ ATM Simulator

## Overview

This project includes a set of files designed to simulate the functioning of EZ ATM. The main executable file, `ATMSimulatorController.exe`, is all you need to start the simulation. Other files are supplementary and assist the main application.

## Instructions

1. **Run the Simulation**:
   - Simply double-click `ATMSimulatorController.exe` to start the ATM simulation.
2. **Supplementary Files**:
   - **data.txt**: This file contains account information necessary for the simulation. Ensure it is in the same directory as `ATMSimulatorController.exe`.
   - **demo_consistent.exe**: This is a supplementary file used for demonstration purposes.
   - **demo_inconsistent.exe**: This is another supplementary file for demonstration purposes.
